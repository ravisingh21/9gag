    "I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to make America great again," he tweeted in a series of missives sent before dawn. "While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses."

  He said legal documents are "being crafted which take me completely out of business operations," he added, saying the presidency is "a far more important task!"

  Meanwhile, former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin, Trump's former campaign finance director, confirmed that Trump has picked him as treasury secretary and that billionaire investor Wilbur Ross has been chosen for commerce secretary.

  Mnuchin, 53, led Trump's finance operations during the presidential campaign. But he has no government experience, which could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics of Washington. If confirmed by the Senate, Mnuchin would play a central role in shaping Trump's tax policies and infrastructure plans. He would also lead an agency tasked with implementing international economic sanctions.

  Asked about Trump's announcement on separating himself from his business empire, Reince Priebus, Trump's incoming White House chief of staff, said "that'll all be worked out."

  Priebus said Wednesday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," that "he's got the best people in America working on it." Priebus demurred when asked if Trump planned to put his businesses in a blind trust or leave them in the hands of his adult children.
